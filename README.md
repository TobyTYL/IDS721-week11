# IDS721-week11

## Description: 

In this program, we use Rust's rand crate to generate a random password. 
* First, we define the string containing the available characters and the length of the password. 
* Then, we use the thread_rng() and gen_range() methods in rand crate to generate a random number and correspond the random number to the characters in the string to generate a random password. 
* Finally, we use the println!() method to output the generated password to the console.
